# DistributedSystems

This project focuses on different aspects of distributed systems. It is divided into 3 labs: Lab1, Lab2 and Lab3.

Lab 1 aims to provide the ability to client to:
• Create directories;
• Delete directories;
• Move directories;
• Rename directories; and,
• List the contents of directories.

Lab 2 is an extension to Lab 1. It aims to implement synchronization and desynchronization between client and server.

Lab 3 is an extension to Lab 2. It aims to implement "UNDO" operation made by client.
